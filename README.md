Rest Assured Book API Framework
This project is a robust API automation framework designed to verify the key functionalities of a FastAPI-powered BookStore application. It offers end-to-end test coverage for:

üîÅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

‚ö†Ô∏è Error and edge case handling

üîê Authentication and security validations

With comprehensive reporting and smooth CI/CD integration, this framework ensures consistent, high-quality feedback throughout the development lifecycle.

Technologies & Framework Stack
Java (17): Primary language used to implement framework logic

RestAssured: For automating and validating RESTful API endpoints

TestNG: Manages test execution flow and configurations

ExtentReports: Produces rich, interactive HTML reports for test results

Maven: Handles project builds, dependencies, and lifecycle phases

GitHub Actions: Enables CI/CD for automated testing and deployments

Scope of Test Coverage
The framework covers the following test scenarios for Health check, User, and Book APIs:

Expected Functional Outcomes
Verify if the server is up and running

Register a new user and log in with valid credentials

Add a new book using valid input data

Fetch the complete list of books

Retrieve details of a specific book by its ID

Modify the details of an existing book

Remove a book from the system

Negative Validations
Access APIs with invalid or missing tokens
Attempt to get non-existent books
Sign-up/login with invalid credentials
Request Chaining
The access token obtained from the login API is dynamically applied to subsequent requests‚Äîsuch as create, update, and delete book operations‚Äîfacilitating smooth request chaining.

Test Strategy
API Test Case Architecture
Designed modular test classes for each core resource: User, Book, and Health

Leveraged dependsOnGroups to handle inter-class dependencies (e.g., Book tests require a successful login)

Implemented request chaining to support token-based authentication flows

Utilized a centralized data.json file for input data, promoting cleaner and more maintainable test code
2.Scalability
Configurable base URL and tokens using config.properties
Clear separation of concerns: logic, request specs, data, reporting
Assertions for status codes, response structure, and error messages
Positive and negative test cases for all endpoints
Common utility methods for validation
Used BaseTest and Listeners to manage test lifecycle and reports
3. Challenges & Resolutions
Challenge	Resolution
API returned 500 instead of 422 for invalid inputs	Implemented payload validation and added assertions to identify backend misbehavior
API returned 400 for undocumented cases	Recommended enhancing Swagger documentation for accuracy
Missing Delete API for User resource	Proposed adding a Delete endpoint or implementing user reuse strategies in tests
Interdependent test classes causing execution issues	Adopted dependsOnGroups to manage test flow more effectively
No backend validation for empty email or book name	Highlighted the issue and suggested server-side input validation
How to Run the Tests
Prerequisites
Java 17+
